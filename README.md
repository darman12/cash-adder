# Cash Adder
Quick-and-dirty cash adder that supports USD.

Made to easily calculate how much money you have in cash. Better than a calculator because you don't have to redo the calculation completely if you fat-finger the keys.

Doesn't support change because I'm lazy... counting change by hand is kinda fun anyway.
